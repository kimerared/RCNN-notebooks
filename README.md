# Computer Vision: Object Detection using Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of object detection using three popular algorithms: Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8. These models are widely used in the field of computer vision for tasks such as object localization and segmentation.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   TensorFlow
-   Keras
-   OpenCV
-   NumPy

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.

2.  Install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the specific model directory (e.g., faster_rcnn, mask_rcnn, yolov8).
2.  Run the respective script for training or inference:

## Dataset

Ensure you have a dataset in COCO format or a custom dataset for training the models. Modify the data loading functions in the scripts accordingly.

## Results

You can find the trained models and evaluation results in the respective model directories.

## Experimental Models

There are two models that we experimented with to expedite the annotation process:

-   SAM (Segment Anything Model)

-   YOLO-World

Code notebooks for each model are available in their respective folders.

## Web Applications

For your convenience, we have provided the following links for the web applications.
