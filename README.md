# Computer Vision Object Detection using Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of object detection using three popular algorithms: Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8. These models are widely used in the field of computer vision for tasks such as object localization and segmentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the required dependencies.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the specific model directory (e.g., faster_rcnn, mask_rcnn, yolov8).
2. Run the respective script for training or inference:


## Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset in COCO format or a custom dataset for training the models. Modify the data loading functions in the scripts accordingly.

## Results
You can find the trained models and evaluation results in the respective model directories.
